# cnnBCI

A series of experiments were done with the objective to perform binary classification of EEG
data related to physical reaction tasks using a convolutional network model. Datasets used for classification correspond to a hand-squeeze experiment and a simulated driving experiment. They're both available online.Hyperparameters such as ConvNetâ€™s number, Kernel Size,convolutional layer depth, batch size were varied. Pre-processing techniques of data to complement
classification performance was included. Experiments show that this type of architecture combina-
tions did not perform well, obtaining accuracy rates that did not go past .70
